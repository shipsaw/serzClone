Every bin begins with the letters "SERZ"

A newline is indicated by 0xFF, and depending on the following three bits means several different things.  The order of the attributes is important.
	FF FF 50 FF is a line that has children, and has the optional attribute "d:id"
	The full format is: FF FF 50 FF, 4 bytes to indicate tag name length, tag name, d:id attribute value, 4 bytes to indicate number of children

	FF FF 56 FF is a line that has no children, and the optional attributes are: "d:type d:precision d:alt_encoding"
	The full format is: FF FF 56 FF, 4 bytes to store tag name length, tag name, two bits to indicate whether the d:id type needs to be described, or can be implied from the previous element.  
	FF FF means this is the first instance of this type, and is followed by 4 bytes to store the attribute d:type.  This is then followed by the attribute value, then the required bytes for the content.
	If this is not the first instance of this type, then there are two byes that describe how it is linked to the previous element, than the bytes for the content.

	FF FF 41 FF is a line that has no children, and the optional attribues are "d:precision d:elementType d:numElements"  The precision is always "string" and is added automatically by the converter.
	The full formal it: FF FF 41 FF, 4 bytes to store tag name length, tag name, two that are still a mystery, than 4 content values
