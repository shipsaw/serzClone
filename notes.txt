Every bin begins with the letters "SERZ"

	A newline is indicated by 0xFF, and depending on the following three bits means several different things.  The order of the attributes is important.
	FF 50 FF FF is a line that has children, and has the optional attribute "d:id"
	The full format is: FF FF 50 FF, 4 bytes to indicate tag name length, tag name, d:id attribute value, 4 bytes to indicate number of children
	If a ff 50 has no children, it is a closed tag with format <[tagname]/>

	FF 56 FF FF is a line that has no children, and the optional attributes are: "d:type d:precision d:alt_encoding"
	The full format is: FF FF 56 FF, 4 bytes to store tag name length, tag name, two bits to indicate whether the 
	d:id type needs to be described, or can be implied from the previous element.  

	FF FF means this is the first instance of this type, and is followed by 
	4 bytes to store the attribute d:type.  This is then followed by the attribute value, then the required bytes for the content.
	If this is not the first instance of this type, then there are two byes that describe how it is linked to the previous element, than the bytes for the content.

	FF 41 FF FF is a line that has no children, and the optional attribues are
	 "d:precision d:elementType d:numElements"  numElements is the attribute that seperates it from the FF 56. The precision is always "string" and is added automatically by the converter.
	The full formal it: FF FF 41 FF, 4 bytes to store tag name length, tag name, two that are still a mystery, than 4 content values

	FF 70 XX XX is a closing tag.  Every FF 50 increases a count of how deep we are in the document.  XX XX is a 16-bit little-endian representation of the depth 
	that we are "popping out" of

	The symbols used in the xml document are often not represented in the bin, and those that are are stored in a table so that no space is wasted 
	writing duplicate symbols.  Every new symbol is inserted into the table with an 16-bit index (which starts at 0), and any repititions in the xml
	are represented in the bin by the index

	The alt_encoding value in the xml is simply the little-endian representation of the content's 64-bit encoding
